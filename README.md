# Health_database_system
The goal of this project is to build a real world database application for a health system. The software will have interface that allows the user to interact with the program. The user can then view, edit, and do some other command to the database through the interface. The project describes a real world problem and is implemented in the Java Language with Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) database API.

The designing of Health Information System is strictly following general database design process: requirements analysis, conceptual database design, logical database design, schema refinement, physical database design, and application and security design. This process results in an entity relational model, a schema implementation (in MySQL) and a programed software (in Java). Health Information System will be able to import the data from an xml or a sql file and output them into the created existing database. The software system then provides three interfaces ”Patient”, ”Doctor”, and ”Administrator”. The three interfaces are meant for the interactive users ­ one for patients, one for doctors and one for administrators who will perform several queries on the data.
